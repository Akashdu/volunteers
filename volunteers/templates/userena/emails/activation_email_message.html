        To work together efficiently, we could really use a recognisable id photo, a mobile phone number, and tasks you will work on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please after signing up, add your photo id and mobile phone number at
https://volunteers.fosdem.org/volunteers/<your_id>/edit/ (signin
required)

    </p>
    <p>
        Please also pick your tasks at https://volunteers.fosdem.org/tasks (signin
required)
    </p>
    <p>
       No idea which task to pick? The slots with the highest priority for us
to fill are, in order of importance.:
* any unfilled infodesk K slots
* any unfilled Friday buildup or Sunday cleanup slots
* any heralding slots with no volunteers yet (including lightning
talks heralding)
* any cloak room slot with no volunteers yet
* any Signage Placement slot, especially if the task has half or less the needed number of volunteers
* any video slot
* any other slot 
    </p>

        Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or remarks you might have at <a href="mailto:volunteers@fosdem.org">volunteers@fosdem.org</a> or +32 27 88 74 72 during the event.<br />

        P.S. We are very much aware of the responsibility that comes with asking you for privacy sensitive information like photo id and mobile phone number. We use it extremely carefully and sparingly, and obviously for FOSDEM only.
