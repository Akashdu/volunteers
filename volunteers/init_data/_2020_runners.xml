            A small pool of available "on-call" volunteers to assist with any issue that might crop up. Most of the
            time, it's small tasks that need doing (take X to Y in building Z), but it could also be replacing a
            volunteer that didn't show up for a task. You'll probably learn more of the campus than you would think
            possible.

            You'll need some knowledge of the campus to work efficiently, so if you have that, you would be very
            welcome!

            Meeting place is the K infodesk.
