        <description>Any bit of time you can spare on Friday will be helpful! Ideally you can be there from 12:00 until ready. Experience learns us we'll be ready between 18:30 and 22:00 (hard deadline, have to leave the building). Just come in as early you can! We'll have some pizza or other food in the evening. Deadline is 22:00. Some of us go to the beer event afterwards.

This task includes many subtasks. Some require carrying heavy stuff around, some don't. We need to set up stands (tables, chairs), cover the walls in brown paper, put signalization in place, run power cords, ... There will be 3 work areas, each with their own coordinator.</description>

        <description>Organising an event requires lots of stuff to be brought on-site. Things like scaffolding, the O'Reilly books, T-shirts, network gear, ... - some of this stuff may be heavy, so if yo enlist for this, make sure you're OK with lifting potentially heavy objects.

While having a mobile phone number is strongly encouraged for any volunteer, it's mandatory for those signing up for this task as the drivers of the vans need a way to contact you to pick you up somewhere along the way, or when you're running late. ;)</description>

        <description>We need to leave the premises in a presentable state. Everything we bring and set up must be torn down and removed. All signalization removed, network torn down (go wild; we don't reuse the cables!), tables and chairs stacked so the rental company can load them up when they retrieve them, the floors wiped, ...

Don't damage the building, but make sure none of our stuff remains behind.

Normally we're finished around 9pm, but we stay until we're done.

As many volunteers as possible! That way, it won't take too long. :)</description>

        <description>During the event, we offer visitors a place to leave their coats and luggage. It's usually very busy at the start and end of the day; in between it's quite relaxed.

You take the person's coat and/or luggage or other small items for storage, and pin a ticket with a number on it. The other half of the ticket is given to the visitor, so he can reclaim his stuff later.

Keep things organized: during rush hour you want to be able to find things quickly because rush is hell.


Location

    If the cloakroom is still closed in the morning, try to find somebody of the regular fosdem staff who can contact security to open the room up for us. Jan-Frederik can be reached on +32.496.959400, Juan on +32.496.737018 and Bart on +32.498.409653

IMPORTANT Notes

    Since this is in between offices of profs and other University staff, please keep it tidy and keep the noise down, especially during setup on friday!!!!. Try not to damage any walls ;)</description>

Must be a good English speaker, but if you know other languages besides that it certainly won’t hurt. At infodesk K, you are working alongside experienced staff. At infodesk H, you might be thrown to the lions :)

The hours are a bit flexible. If you have to leave 10 minutes early, or if you arrive 10 minutes later, that's not an issue, AS LONG as you make sure you're covered. Usually the infodesk crew kind of self-organises a bit so that it's possible to take a break to go see a talk by making sure there's someone to cover you.</description>

Your tasks will mainly consist of rolling out, neatly securing and crimping UTP cables. People with experience crimping cables are very welcome to help out! Once all cables have been laid down, the access points need to be installed and secured.</description>

        <description>Lightning talks are aimed at projects that do not fit in one of the devrooms. Each selected speaker gets exactly 15 minutes to present the project or any aspect of it. All the lightning talks happen in a large room that can host up to 300 people.

The lightningtalk schedule is quite busy: https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/lightning_talks/

Each talk is 15 minutes, with 5 minute breaks in between.


= Heralding =

Your task as moderator is to guarantee that the schedule timing is respected. You will also help the speakers in setting up their presentation and microphone/pointer, and thank them with a gift at the end of the talk.  If you wish, you may also briefly introduce each speaker.

You will also be backup for video.

Strong points for this task are that you are not afraid to speak to a large audience ( or want to overcome it :-) ) and that you like to meet and help different open source developers/speakers. The topics are very varied, so it's usually very interesting to moderate.


= Video =

Your task as video volunteer is to check if the video's are being recorded correct and if the camera is pointed towards the presenter. Ideally, you don't have to touch it and it all work fine.

You will also be backup for heralding.


= Speakers =

The speakers are given the following instructions:

We have a lot of talks, each allocated a short timeslot. To make this work, it is crucial that there is no deviation from the time schedule. The moderator's most important task is to make sure that the time schedule is respected. You have to stay focussed on the clock and how much time the speaker has left and give them clues.

To ensure a smooth switch between speakers, please:
* Attend the lightningtalk before you (= 20 minutes before your talk)
* There are 5 minute breaks for speaker switches:
** You can copy your slides from a USB key onto the presentation PC
** You can use your own laptop, but have a fallback on USB
** We will give you a microphone and pointer device
* We will shortly introduce your talk
* Then, we will set a kitchen timer to exactly 15 minutes

When the kitchen timer rings, your speaking time is over!

We will close your talk with a thank you word. You can suggest people with questions to meet you in front.


= Briefing =

You will be briefed by the lightningtalk organizer prior to moderation or will be briefed by fellow volunteers.
There will also be sheets available with instructions/reminders.</description>

Strong points for this task are that you are not afraid to speak to a large audience ( or want to overcome it :-) ) and that you like to meet and help different open source developers/speakers. The topics are very varied, so it's usually very interesting to moderate.


= Video =

Your task as video volunteer is to check if the video's are being recorded correct and if the camera is pointed towards the presenter. Ideally, you don't have to touch it and it all work fine.

You will also be backup for heralding.


= Speakers =

The speakers are given the following instructions:

We have a lot of talks, each allocated a short timeslot. To make this work, it is crucial that there is no deviation from the time schedule. The moderator's most important task is to make sure that the time schedule is respected. You have to stay focussed on the clock and how much time the speaker has left and give them clues.

To ensure a smooth switch between speakers, please:
* Attend the lightningtalk before you (= 20 minutes before your talk)
* There are 5 minute breaks for speaker switches:
** You can copy your slides from a USB key onto the presentation PC
** You can use your own laptop, but have a fallback on USB
** We will give you a microphone and pointer device
* We will shortly introduce your talk
* Then, we will set a kitchen timer to exactly 15 minutes

When the kitchen timer rings, your speaking time is over!

We will close your talk with a thank you word. You can suggest people with questions to meet you in front.


= Briefing =

You will be briefed by the lightningtalk organizer prior to moderation or will be briefed by fellow volunteers.
There will also be sheets available with instructions/reminders.</description>

        <description>The beer event is (one of) the greatest FOSDEM-side-activities. During Friday night, the Delirium Café is ours and we organize a world-famous beer event with equally famous Belgian beers.

Your role is to separate those who are allowed to enter from those who are not. The café is reserved exclusively for FOSDEM use, and while the security knows this, they don't speak English or know what FOSDEM is. So your role will be to check whether a visitor is indeed FOSDEM-related, and if so, to stamp their wrists in order for them to gain continued entry.

You'll also be responsible for selling the tokens visitors can buy beer (or other drinks) with.

Perks of the job are plentiful. You'll meet a great amount of interesting people, have guaranteed access to Delirium and we'll ensure your throat never goes dry.</description>

        <description>The beer event is (one of) the greatest FOSDEM-side-activities. During Friday night, the Delirium Café is ours and we organize a world-famous beer event with equally famous Belgian beers.

Your role is to separate those who are allowed to enter from those who are not. The café is reserved exclusively for FOSDEM use, and while the security knows this, they don't speak English or know what FOSDEM is. So your role will be to check whether a visitor is indeed FOSDEM-related, and if so, to stamp their wrists in order for them to gain continued entry.

You'll also be responsible for selling the tokens visitors can buy beer (or other drinks) with.

Perks of the job are plentiful. You'll meet a great amount of interesting people, have guaranteed access to Delirium and we'll ensure your throat never goes dry.</description>
